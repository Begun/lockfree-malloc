ABOUT
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a drop-in replacement for malloc/free that is designed from
the ground up to be used in scalable server software.

Why another memory allocator?


Here are the advantages of our allocator:

 * It's thread-friendly. It supports a practically-unlimited number of
   concurrent threads, without locking or performance degradation.

 * It's efficient, especially in a multi-threaded environment.
   Compared to a stock libc allocator, we see a significant
   performance boost.

 * It does NOT fragment or leak memory, unlike a stock libc allocator.

 * It wastes less memory. For small objects (less than 8kb in size),
   the overhead is around 0 bytes. (!)

 * It is designed from the ground-up for 64-bit architectures.

 * It is elegant. The whole codebase is only around 800 lines of
   fairly clean C++. (!)

 * It fully stand-alone; it does not rely on pthreads or libc at runtime.


The disadvantages:

 * Works only with a x86_64 CPU.

 * It does not try to economise on virtual memory mapping space.

 * Memory used for small objects (those less than 128kb in size) is
   cached within the allocator and is never released back to the OS. 
   In practice, this means that your app will stabilize at some peak
   usage of memory and will, from that moment on, rarely ask the OS
   for memory allocation or deallocation.

PLEASE NOTE: the functions memalign, posix_memalign and valloc are not supported by our allocator.

USAGE
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Build requirements:

For building the library, you will need:

 * g++


Usage requirements:

 * An x86_64 CPU.

 * An OS with sane mmap/munmap support. 
   We have production-tested only on Linux. (But it should work with FreeBSD too.)


Compiling:

Edit Makefile to set your build options; type 'make' to build a static 
and a shared version of the library.

Note: we recommend integrating the allocator into your own
project(s). The enclosed Makefile is intended only as a demonstration,
not a complete build solution.


Using the library: 

There are five options:

 1. Compile into a statically-linked application. 
    For this, you must: 
      * Compile your application's object files as normal. 
      * Compile 'lite-malloc.cpp', or use the
       'liblite-malloc-static.a' generated with the enclosed Makefile.
      * Link your app with the '-static' flag, and these linker flags
        for wrapping:

   -Wl,--wrap,malloc -Wl,--wrap,free -Wl,--wrap,calloc
   -Wl,--wrap,realloc -Wl,--wrap,memalign -Wl,--wrap,valloc
   -Wl,--wrap,posix_memalign 

 2. Link with a shared library. Linking with
    'liblite-malloc-shared.so' should work.

 3. Via standard glibc malloc hooks.
    To enable, just include 'lite-hooks.h' as the first line of your program.

 4. Via the magic LD_PRELOAD environment variable:

   $ LD_PRELOAD=<full pathname>/liblite-malloc-shared.so <your application>

 5. Compile a malloc hook static library into your dynamically-linked application.
    Follow the instructions in option 1, except omit the '-static' flag, and add these linker flags:

   -Wl,--defsym=malloc=__wrap_malloc -Wl,--defsym=free=__wrap_free -Wl,--defsym=calloc=__wrap_calloc
   -Wl,--defsym=realloc=__wrap_realloc -Wl,--defsym=memalign=__wrap_memalign -Wl,--defsym=valloc=__wrap_valloc
   -Wl,--defsym=posix_memalign=__wrap_posix_memalign


IMPORTANT NOTES:

Linux has an OS-imposed limit on the number of virtual memory mappings.
If you want to allocate large amounts of memory, you may need to adjust this 
limit via /proc/sys/vm/max_map_count.
